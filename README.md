# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹
This is a little test of a website that's entirely created in jQuery which is really cool.

Here you'll find all the files that my website uses. It's unorganized currently, but I'll organize it in the future... as soon as I can figure out why I can't link my JavaScript files that are placed in folders.

## ðŸ’» Stuff I use ðŸ’»
Atom, which is owned by Github, which is also owned by Microsoft.

Khan Academy, the ones that taught me how to program this thing.
