# Welcome to my website!
This is a little test of a website that's entirely created in jQuery which is really cool.

Here you'll find all the files that my website uses. It's unorganized currently, but I'll organize it in the future... as soon as I can figure out why I can't link my JavaScript files that are placed in folders.

## The thank you section
A whole bunch of thanks to:

Khan Academy, for teaching me how to make my first website and still teaching me to this day.
GitHub, for giving me the space and editor (Atom) to create my own site.
Discord App, for allowing me to chat with my friends and get a first review of my site.
