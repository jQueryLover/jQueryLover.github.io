# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹
This is a little test of a website that's entirely created in jQuery which is really cool.

Here you'll find all the files that my website uses. It's unorganized currently, but I'll organize it in the future... as soon as I can figure out why I can't link my JavaScript files that are placed in folders.

## ðŸ’» Stuff I use ðŸ’»
Atom, which is owned by Github, which is also owned by Microsoft.

Khan Academy, the ones that taught me how to program this thing.

## ðŸ“¦ Packages I use (exclusing default Atom packages) ðŸ“¦
`atom-clock` - Self explanatory. It's useful to have a clock in the status bar ~~because I'm too lazy to use the default Windows clock~~.

`atom-discord` - I have no idea why I decided to get this. It's a good package either way.

`color-picker` - Essential when I'm working with colours. I hate having to open up a RGB colour picker or something on the web, so it's nice to have a integrated one.

`jQuery` - Just a collection of snippets for jQuery.

`linter-eslint` - This hasn't worked yet for me, but one day it will!

`seti-icons` - Also important. Combined with the material theme it looks really good.
